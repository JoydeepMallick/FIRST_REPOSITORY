    <p title="Family" style="color:rgb(255, 253, 250); font-size: 30px; background-color: #71f79f;">My name is Joydeep Mallick. I live in 9/19 Newton Avenue, B-Zone, Durgapur-713205. I have 3 family members in my family including me,my grandfather and my mother. My father is giving private service in Raipur.</p> 
    
    <p title="Education" style="color:rgb(255, 253, 250); font-size: 28px; background-color: #3dd6d0;"> I completed my class 10 from ICSE board in 2019 at Pranavananda Vidyamandir situated in B-zone area. Again I passed my 12<sup>th</sup> standard from CBSE board in 2021 at Dayananda Arya Vidyalaya which is also located in B-zone area.</p>
    
    <p title="Education" style="color:rgb(255, 253, 250); font-size: 26px; background-color: #26aedf;">Presently I am enrolled in Computer Science and Engineering at <b style="color:gold;">Dr. B.C. Roy Engineering college</b> located at Jemua road, Fuljhore, Durgapur-713206. I recived this college under West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination counselling. I chose this college over other colleges due to lesser travel distance and availability of transport in case of emergency. </p>
    
    <p title="Enlightenment" style="color:rgb(255, 253, 250); font-size: 25px; background-color: #15b097;">My hobbies include learning new things like cooking, painting. I found my interest in Computer Science during class 11 when I had been strugging hard to solve a simple problem on loop which many of my classmates could solve in seconds. That let me an urge to explore various possibilties of the solution and doing research over the internet. That opened the vastness of computer programing in front of me. My aim in life is to presently earn a <i style="color: rgb(245, 170, 170);">B.Tech</i> degree and get a job to support my family economically who have supported me at every point of my life.</p>
    
    <p title="Leisure" style="color:rgb(255, 253, 250); font-size: 24px; background-color: #b4a0e5;">I spend my leisure time in watching youtube about how to open a computer or laptop and then reassemble it which makes me cuorius how can such a small compact thing be yet so powerful to make the work of people easier.I sometimes watch movies also and read books too.</p>
    
    <p title="Greatest learning" style="color:rgb(255, 253, 250); font-size: 22px; background-color: #C59FC9;">The greatest lesson I learnt in my life from my family is patience and hard work. This is little I have to say about myself. Wish everyone a prosperous life ahead.</p>
